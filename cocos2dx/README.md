This project works alongside with SOOMLA for Cocos2dx.

* If you haven't already done so, head over to Vungle's [dashboard](https://v.vungle.com/dashboard/login) and add your app to your account. You need to do this so that you can get your App ID that you’ll be initializing `SoomlaVungle` with. It’s in **red** on your app’s page.



# This is an experimental project which is currently outdated. You can work with the Android / iOS / Unity parts of this plugin
